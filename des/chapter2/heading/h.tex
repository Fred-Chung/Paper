\chapter{Basic language}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this chapter we outline the general context in which our study of multiplier
theory in Banach spaces
takes place. We begin by revising the elementary concepts
associated with functional analysis in Banach spaces. Then Section \ref{bases}
introduces the notions of bases, multiplier transforms and unconditional
convergence of sequences, setting the scene for the rest of the thesis. The
chapter ends by introducing a technique which is frequently used to obtain
results pertaining to the unconditionality of sequences.
