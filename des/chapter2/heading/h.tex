In this chapter we outline the basic background of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
. We begin by reviswing the Bayesian Theorem
associated with functional analysis in LDA. Then some common statistic distributions
 will be introduced which are used in inferencing posterior distribution and latend parameters.Sampling techniques such as Gibbs Sampling which is frequently used to obtain results of model will be listed in last subsection.
