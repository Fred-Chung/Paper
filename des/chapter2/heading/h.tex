This chapter outlines the background of Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Inference method. Firstly, Bayesian Theorem associated with functional analysis in LDA will be revised. Then some common statistic distributions which are used in inferencing posterior distribution and latend parameters will be introduced. Sampling techniques such as Gibbs Sampling which is frequently used to obtain results of model will be listed in last subsection.
