\section{Topologies in Banach Spaces}\label{topologies}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
A Banach space $\X$ is easily made a topological space with the topology induced
by its norm, called the {\em norm topology} of $\X$. We say a sequence of
vectors {\em converges in $\X$} if it converges in the norm topology of $\X$.
Another
topology is the {\em weak topology} of $\X$. A sequence $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$
of vectors in $\X$ converges to $x\in\X$ in the weak topology of $\X$ if
$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\ip<x_n-x,x^*>=0$ for all $x^*\in\X^*$. As their names
suggest, convergence in the norm topology implies convergence in the weak
topology, or in other words, if a sequence converges then it also converges
weakly.

We shall consider three topologies in the Banach space $\B(\X)$.
Suppose $\{T_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of operators in $\B(\X)$.
We say it
converges to $T$ {\em in norm} if $\norm{T-T_n}\rightarrow 0$, {\em strongly} if
$\norm{Tx-T_nx}_{\X}\rightarrow 0$ for all $x\in\X$, and {\em weakly} if
$\ip<Tx-T_nx,x^*>\rightarrow 0$ for all $x\in\X$ and $x^*\in\X^*$. The
topologies
induced are called the norm operator topology, the strong operator topology and
the weak
operator topology of $\B(\X)$ respectively. A sequence which converges strongly
will converge weakly, and in turn, convergence in the norm topology implies
strong convergence. All three topologies have unique limits and distinguish
points.

The following proposition is easy to verify and is included for familiarisation
with the concepts discussed thus far. It shall also be used to establish later
results.

\begin{proposition}\label{SOT convergence}
Let $\X$ be a Banach space and suppose $\{T_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of
operators uniformly bounded in norm by some $K>0$ and converging to $T$
in the strong operator topology of $\B(\X)$. Then $\norm{T}\leq
K$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We want to show $\norm{Tx}_{\X}\leq K\norm{x}_{\X}$ for all $x\in\X$. Fix
$x\in\X$ and $\epsilon>0$ and choose an $n\in\N$ such that
$\norm{Tx-T_nx}_{\X}<\epsilon$. Then
\[\norm{Tx}_{\X}\leq\norm{Tx-T_nx}_{\X}+\norm{T_nx}_{\X}
<\epsilon+K\norm{x}_{\X},\]
and the proposition follows.
\end{proof}
