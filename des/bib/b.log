./b.tex:151: LaTeX Error: Lonely \item--perhaps a missing list environment.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...

Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

./b.tex:151: Undefined control sequence.
<argument> \@listctr 
                     
l.151 {Stein}
             
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

./b.tex:151: You can't use `\relax' after \the.
<recently read> \c@ 
                    
l.151 {Stein}
             
I'm forgetting what you said and using zero instead.
