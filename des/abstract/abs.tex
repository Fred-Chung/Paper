\begin{enumerate}

  Topic model, especially latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA),has aroused grea research interest in the past two decades which is a useful tools for document classification.The LDA model assumes that word of doucment is determined by the topic of document and topic-word matrix. Some multi-layer generative process on word distribution on have been proposed to improve LDA. However it suffer from information decay and complicate samping method. This thesis presented a Dirichlet-Belief Networks to address problems above. By inserting auxiliary Poisson random variables into the layerwise connections and appropriate design, this thesis inference latent parameter in an efficient way. As an Bayesian generatice model,it is more interpretability and gibbs sampling can be used in training model.
